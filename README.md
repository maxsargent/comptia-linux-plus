# CompTia Linux+

This repo contains code snippets and explanatory comments to help work towards a CompTia Linux+ certification. CompTia Linux+ is an entry level qualification, a great place to start if you have experience with IT but have never operated outside of Windows, or never worked in a terminal.

This repo is by no means all that is required to pass the certification exam, but it will help. Specifically you should clone this repository and play with the code snippets to help gain an understanding of the Linux environment. Following that aim to extend the functionality of some snippets where possible.

The topics covered can be found [here](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-linux-xk0-004-exam-objectives.pdf), the official CompTia Linux+ exam objectives.
